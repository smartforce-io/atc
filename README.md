## Deploy the backend
### Add pem data to KMS
Check that the kms api is enabled: [cloudkms.googleapis.com](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/cloudkms.googleapis.com).
1. Create a keyring
```shell script
gcloud kms keyrings create atc-secrets --location=global
```
2. Create a key
```shell script
gcloud kms keys create gh-pem-secret \
    --location=global \
    --keyring atc-secrets \
    --purpose encryption
```
### Encrypting a Github Private key
```shell script
gcloud kms encrypt \
    --plaintext-file=gh.pem \
    --ciphertext-file=ghpem.enc.txt \
    --location=global \
    --keyring=atc-secrets \
    --key=gh-pem-secret

base64 ghpem.enc.txt -w 0 > ghpem.enc.64.txt
```
### Grant permissions
Add to `serviceAccount` (1007563553609@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com) permissions:
```
Cloud Build Service Account
Cloud KMS CryptoKey Decrypter
Storage Object Viewer
```
Also you should follow the steps:
 1. Grant the Cloud Run Admin role to the Cloud Build service account:
     * In the Cloud Console, go to the Cloud Build Settings page:
     * Open the Settings page
     * Locate the row with the Cloud Run Admin role and set its Status to ENABLED.
     * In the Additional steps may be required pop-up, click Skip.

 2. Grant the IAM Service Account User role to the Cloud Build service account on the Cloud Run runtime service account:
     * In the Cloud Console, go to the Service Accounts page:
     * Open the Service Accounts page
     * In the list of members, locate and select [PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com. This is the Cloud Run runtime service account.
     * Click SHOW INFO PANEL in the top right corner.
     * In the Permissions panel, click the Add Member button.
     * In the New member field, enter the email address of the Cloud Build service account. This is of the form [PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com. Note: The email address of Cloud Build service account is different from that of Cloud Run runtime service account.
     * In the Role dropdown, select Service Accounts, and then Service Account User.
